# Introduction

This repository provides a complete **Terraform Enterprise (TFE) development environment** that runs locally on macOS, designed for testing, development, and learning purposes.

## Architecture Overview

The setup creates a production-like TFE environment using modern containerization and cloud-native technologies:

- **🖥️ Local Development**: Runs entirely on macOS using Podman Desktop plus a local Minikube Kubernetes cluster (Podman driver)
- **☁️ External Access**: Leverages Cloudflare tunnels for secure external connectivity without port forwarding
- **🔒 Enterprise Security**: Includes proper SSL certificates and DNS management through Cloudflare
- **📦 Microservices Architecture**: Deploys TFE alongside supporting services (PostgreSQL, MinIO, Redis) as Kubernetes pods inside Minikube

## Key Components

- **Minikube**: Lightweight local Kubernetes cluster using the Podman driver and CRI-O container runtime
- **Terraform Enterprise**: Full TFE installation with persistent storage and session management
- **Cloudflare Integration**: Automated DNS records and secure tunnel connections for external access
- **Supporting Services**: PostgreSQL (database), MinIO (S3-compatible storage), Redis (caching), and cloudflared (tunnel agent)

## Prerequisites

- macOS with sufficient resources (recommended: 6+ CPU cores, 12+ GB RAM)
- Cloudflare account with API token (DNS and Tunnel permissions required)
- Podman Desktop installed and configured

# Prepare code
## Git
Clone this repository

## terraform.tfvars
Copy the example file `variables.example` to `variables.auto.tfvars`. 

# Podman Desktop
https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/macos-install

Install with brew:
`brew install --cask podman-desktop`

Once installed, start the app and setup a podman machine with 6cpu, 12GB mem and 40GB storage.  
(Or adjust to your likings, just make sure Minikube (and TFE) settings will fit.)

Example:
```
podman machine init --cpus 8 --memory 12000 --disk-size 100
```

Alter it if needed
```
podman machine stop
podman machine set --cpus 6 --memory 8192 --disk-size 150
```


# Minikube
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/podman/  

Install with brew:  
```
brew install minikube
```

Set the driver to podman:  
```
minikube config set driver podman
```

Start minikube with additional parameters:  
```
minikube start -p tfe --driver=podman --container-runtime=cri-o --kubernetes-version=v1.34.0 --cpus=4 --memory=8192
```

Stop minikube:  
```
minikube stop -p tfe
```

This will put the config in kubectl automatically so the kubernetes provider can use it.  
Add the full path of the config file to the variable `kubectl_config_path` in `variables.auto.tfvars`

If you want to access Minio and Postgres (locally) you will need to start a Minikube tunnel.  
This can be done with the following command:  
```
sudo minikube tunnel --profile=tfe
```  
The name you enter at `--profile` must match the name you used in the start command with `-p`, here `tfe`.
The tunnel will automatically detect all services defined as type Loadbalancer and expose them on localhost.

## View in Podman Desktop
Under the Containers section you can now see your created container, named `tfe`.

# Cloudflare
Cloudflare is used for DNS a record and a tunnel, to be able to reach TFE from externally.  

Fill your Cloudflare account id in at `cloudflare_account_id` in the `variables.auto.tfvars`.  
Fill your Cloudflare api token in at `cloudflare_api_token` in the `variables.auto.tfvars`.  
(Your api token must have edit permissions for DNS and Tunnels.). 

## Create Cloudflare api token
Log in to your Cloudflare account and go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens  
![](media/2025-10-27-13-45-05.png)  
Click `Create Token`.

![](media/2025-10-27-13-46-19.png)  
Click `Get started` under `Custom token`.  

![](media/2025-10-27-14-55-35.png)
Give your token a useful name.
And select the permissions:
- Account   Cloudflare Tunnel   edit  
- Zone      DNS                 edit

There are other options to further restrict access, like which Zone, Account or client ip have access.
You can also set a TTL on your token.
Edit these as you see fit.

Click `Continue to summary`.  
Click `Create Token`.  
Copy the token and enter it as the value for `cloudflare_api_token`.  


# Terraform Enterprise
Check the `variables.auto.tfvars` file and adjust all settings to your needs.  

```
terraform init  
terraform apply  
```

```
Plan: 22 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Outputs:
   cloudflare_delete_tunnel_command = "cloudflared tunnel delete tfe-tunnel"
   cloudflare_list_tunnels_command = "cloudflared tunnel list"
   cloudflare_login_command = "cloudflared login"
   minikube_delete_cluster = "minikube delete --profile=tfe"
   minikube_tunnel = "sudo minikube tunnel --profile=tfe"
   minio_console_url = "http://localhost:9001/"
   minio_password = "minioadmin123456"
   minio_user = "minioadmin"
   postgres_url = "postgresql://postgres:postgresql@localhost:5432/postgres"
   tfe_execute_script_to_create_user_admin = "./scripts/configure_tfe.sh tfe1.munnep.com patrick.munne@ibm.com admin secret$321"
   tfe_url = "https://tfe1.munnep.com"
```

Once the apply is complete, run the config script to create an admin user and test organization in TFE.  
The command is given in the output with `tfe_execute_script_to_create_user_admin`.  

Note:  
`terraform destroy` will not destroy the cloudflare tunnel.  
You will need to delete this manually with the command shown after the apply.  
Default is `cloudflared tunnel delete tfe-tunnel-minikube`.

Also the Minikube cluster must be deleted manually.  
`minikube delete -p tfe`
